        # Use a PerspectiveCamera to create few diffrent camera

        first attr is `field of view`
        -> fov is the extent of the scene that is seen on the display at any given moment ( value is degree )

        second is   `aspect ratio`
        -> almost always want to use the width of the element divided by the height ~ or get same result like watch old movie on a widescreen tv
        SQUISHED

        thirth and fourth are the near and far clipping plane
        -> ~ for better performance

        # Renderer - where magic happen
         - when create a Renderer instance, we need to set the size at which we want it to render our app
         use the width and height if the area we want to fill with our app, and in this case is the width and the height of browser window
            + For performance intensive apps, you can give setSize smaller value => window.innerWidth/2 and window.innerHeight/2 make the app render at half size
         - if you want to keep the your app's size but render with lower resolution, you can do by calling setSize with "false" as `updateStyle` - the third argument ( setSize(window.innerWidth/2, window.innerHeight/2, false) ) will render the app with half resolution, given your canvas 100% width and height
    </p>

        # Creating a Cube
         - we need a material to color it and THREEjs comes with several materials. But we stick to the `MeshBasicMaterial` for now. All materials take an object of properties which will be applied to them
         - We only supply a color attribute of "0x00ff00" ( green ) this work same way like CSS or hexcolor
         - Third thing needed is Mesh. A mesh is an object that takes a geometry and applies material to it, which we then can insert to scene and move freely around
         - By default we call scene.add().
